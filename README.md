Associate Professor (Bitr. professor) at Linköping University
– Docent, PhD in Computer Science

I am an Associate Professor, in the KMACS lab (HCS division) at the Department of Computer and Information Science, Linköping University – and part of the LiU Semantic Web research area. My research is focused on explainable AI, including the Semantic Web and knowledge representation. Particular interests include ontology engineering methodologies and ontology design patterns.

I live in Jönköping, Sweden, and have two small children. Non-research-related interests include triathlon, where I have worked as an ITU Technical Official for the past 10 years, and nationally even longer. More recently I have been part of the team behind Jönköping Swimrun. I also enjoy swimming, running and biking myself, when time permits.

### Bio
My main research focus is on applied and industry-relevant research in the area of the Semantic Web and explainable AI. In particular, my focus is on knowledge representation, such as ontologies and knowledge graphs, including ontology-based applications and ontology engineering, and its combination with modern Machine Learning. An important concept throughout my research career has been the notion of ontology design patterns, which was first developed and explored during my PhD. In parallel with Aldo Gangemi (later a colleague at ISTC-CNR), I was the first to coin the term ‘ontology design pattern’, in 2005, and then to define and explore it further.

My PhD dissertation focused on semi-automatic generation of ontologies, so-called ‘ontology learning’, and improving that process based on design patterns. Later, in my postdoc work, the focus shifted towards manual use of ontology design patterns, evaluating their use and usefulness, and developing methods, tools, and methodologies for using them. More recently, my involvement in the Security Link national research network has provided valuable experience in knowledge-based applications in the security domain, in particular decision support systems. In my work at RISE, similar ideas and solutions have been applied also to the e-health domain.

I have published more than 40 peer-reviewed original scientific papers in journals and conference proceedings, and in addition a number of book chapters, workshop contributions, and discussion papers. I currently have a Google scholar h-index of 23 and an i10-index of 37.

In addition to my research work, I have been very active in the Semantic Web research community, served on editorial boards and as a reviewer, as well as chaired several international conferences and workshops, e.g., as the general chair of ESWC 2017, and scientific Program Co-chair of SEMANTiCS 2020 and ISWC 2021, the latter being the most prominent international conference on Semantic Web research. I have also edited around 20 collections of scientific articles. I was one of the founders and the first chair of the Association for Ontology Design and Patterns (2016-2020), and I am currently a member of the board of the Swedish AI Society, as well as a member of the department board at the Computer and Information Science Department and the board of the Technical Faculty at Linköping University.

At the university I am also involved in teaching, and has among other things developed several PhD courses on Semantic Web technologies, as well as a commissioned course on the same topics given at Scania IT in 2019.
